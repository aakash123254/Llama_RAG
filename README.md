## Overview

The RAG system combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models. It retrieves relevant documents or snippets from a knowledge base and uses the Llama language model to generate contextually accurate responses. This approach ensures both factual correctness and natural language fluency.

Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface, making it easy for users to interact with the RAG system.
