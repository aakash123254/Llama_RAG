## Overview

The RAG system combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models. It retrieves relevant documents or snippets from a knowledge base and uses the Llama language model to generate contextually accurate responses. This approach ensures both factual correctness and natural language fluency.

Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface, making it easy for users to interact with the RAG system.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval and generation for accurate and fluent responses.
- **Llama Integration**: Leverages the powerful Llama language model for text generation.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly web interface.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Easily integrate your own dataset or knowledge base.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets and complex queries.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-llama-streamlit.git
   cd rag-llama-streamlit

One-Liner Installation (Windows)
Run the following command in your terminal to set up the project:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-llama-streamlit.git & cd rag-llama-streamlit & python -m venv venv & venv\Scripts\activate & pip install -r requirements.txt & mkdir models data & echo Download Llama weights and place them in the 'models\' directory & streamlit run app.py

Usage
Open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).
Enter your query in the input box and click "Submit".
The system will retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base and generate a response using Llama.
View the results and interact further as needed.
