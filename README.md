## Overview

The RAG system combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models. It retrieves relevant documents or snippets from a knowledge base and uses the Llama language model to generate contextually accurate responses. This approach ensures both factual correctness and natural language fluency.

Streamlit is used to create an interactive web interface, making it easy for users to interact with the RAG system.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval and generation for accurate and fluent responses.
- **Llama Integration**: Leverages the powerful Llama language model for text generation.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly web interface.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Easily integrate your own dataset or knowledge base.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets and complex queries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-llama-streamlit.git
   cd rag-llama-streamlit

One-Liner Installation (Windows)
Run the following command in your terminal to set up the project:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-llama-streamlit.git & cd rag-llama-streamlit & python -m venv venv & venv\Scripts\activate & pip install -r requirements.txt & mkdir models data & echo Download Llama weights and place them in the 'models\' directory & streamlit run app.py

One-Liner Installation (macOS/Linux)
For macOS or Linux users:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-llama-streamlit.git && cd rag-llama-streamlit && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdir models data && echo "Download Llama weights and place them in the 'models/' directory" && streamlit run app.py

Usage
Run the Application :
After completing the installation steps, the Streamlit app will launch in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
Interact with the RAG System :
Enter your query in the input box.
Click the "Submit" button.
The system will retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base and generate a response using the Llama model.
Explore Results :
View the generated response along with the retrieved context.
Use the interface to refine your query or explore further interactions.
Customize :
Add your dataset to the data/ directory.
Update the knowledge base preprocessing logic in utils/preprocess.py if needed.
Project Structure
Hereâ€™s a deeper dive into the project structure:

Advanced Configuration
Customizing the Knowledge Base
Add Your Dataset :
Place your dataset files (e.g., .txt, .csv, .json) in the data/ directory.
Preprocess the Data :
Modify the utils/preprocess.py script to suit your dataset format. This script is responsible for converting raw data into a format suitable for retrieval.
Update Retrieval Logic :
Adjust the utils/retriever.py module to implement custom retrieval strategies (e.g., TF-IDF, BM25, or embeddings-based retrieval).
Fine-Tuning Llama
If you wish to fine-tune the Llama model for your specific use case:

Download the Llama weights and place them in the models/ directory.
Follow the instructions in the Llama documentation to fine-tune the model.
Update the utils/generator.py module to load your fine-tuned model.
